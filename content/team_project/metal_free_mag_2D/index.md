title: Metal-Free Magnetism in 2D Polymers
abstract: We explore how magnetism can emerge purely from carbon and light elements—without the need for transition metals. We design two-dimensional π-conjugated networks such as the Honeycomb-Kagome lattice. These materials exhibit robust spin polarization originating from the intrinsic topology and electronic structure of their building blocks. Remarkably, exotic quantum phenomena have been observed in these systems, including Stoner ferromagnetism and Mott-Hubbard insulating behavior, highlighting the strong correlation effects inherent in purely organic frameworks. Our work demonstrates that magnetism can be engineered in metal-free materials by manipulating the topology, connectivity, and chemical components at the molecular level, paving the way for sustainable spintronic devices and quantum technologies.
