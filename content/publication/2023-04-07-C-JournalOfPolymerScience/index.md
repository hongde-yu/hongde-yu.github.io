### Abstract 

Two-dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c-COFs) are emerging semiconductor materials for optoelectronic and photothermal applications. In particular, the highly tailorable, semiconducting thiophene-based 2D c-COFs have attracted considerable interest due to their nontrivial physicochemical properties such as photo-activity, broad optical absorption, tunable electronic structures, and so forth. Herein, we demonstrate a novel, crystalline 2D c-COF based on thienyl-functionalized benzodithiophene (BDT) and biphenyl (BP) via the Schiff-base polycondensation reaction. The resultant BDT-BP-COF exhibits a broad optical absorption up to ca. 600 nm and decent π-conjugation along the 2D polymer skeleton, as revealed by the optical absorption and theoretical calculations. The favorable π-conjugation and the abundant electron-rich thiophene units confer excellent photo-activity to BDT-BP-COF towards the usage of solar energy. As a proof-of-concept application, we explore BDT-BP-COF in photothermal conversion, in which it shows a fast surface-temperature increase upon light irradiation for seconds.
