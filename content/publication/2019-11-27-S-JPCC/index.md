### Abstract 

The precise control of the molecular position and orientation of its nanoscale assembly on atomic crystals is pivotal for fabricating hybrid organic/inorganic van der Waals heterostructures with targeted functionalities. Recently, we observed the assembly of oleamide into nanoribbons, orienting exclusively along a crystallographic direction on a variety of atomic crystals. Motivated by this observation, we designed a series of long-chain alkanes, alkenes, and their derivatives with −OH, −COOH, and −CONH2 terminal groups to unveil how chemical units regulate the orientation of suparamolecular assembly by density functional theory calculations. We found that the cis-C═C bond can increase the rigidity of long alkyl chains, tailoring angles and van der Waals interactions between them, while the −CONH2 group facilitates intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Either of these two moieties is required for the oriented assembly on both hexagonal and orthorhombic atomic lattices. We predicted that nanoribbons formed by long-chain cis-alkene and derivatives orient along the zigzag direction on graphene and 32° deflected from the armchair direction on black phosphorene, which were supported by the experiment. The fundamental understandings toward the chemical group regulated intermolecular interactions, and their interplay in the oriented supramolecular assembly is expected to substantially expedite the design and controlled synthesis of organic/inorganic van der Waals heterostructures using the bottom-up method.
