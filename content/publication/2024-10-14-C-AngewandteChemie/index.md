### Abstract 

The emerging laser writing represents an efficient and promising strategy for covalent two dimensional (2D)-patterning of graphene yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of applicable reagents. Here, we report a versatile approach for covalent laser patterning of graphene using a family of trivalent organic iodine compounds as effective reagents, allowing for the engraving of a library of functionalities onto the graphene surface. The relatively weak iodine-centered bonds within these compounds can readily undergo laser-induced cleavage to in situ generate radicals localized to the irradiated regions for graphene binding, thus completing the covalent 2D-structuring of this 2D-film. The tailor-made attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties as well as their thermally reversible binding manner enables programming the surface properties of graphene. With this delicate strategy the bottleneck of a limited scope of functional groups patterned onto the graphene surface upon laser writing is tackled.
